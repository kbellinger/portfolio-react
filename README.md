# Kaylene Ellinger Portfolio

I am using React to create my portfolio to showcase all that I have learned so far. To see the portfolio you can go to the github pages environment in the side bar.

I wanted to get more practice with React, specifically using React Router, MUI, and styling components.

# Web Pages

There are four different pages that can all be accessed within one anohter using React Router. The home page provides an introduction, skills, preview of projects, and a contact form as well as a navigation. The Resume page will have a small about paragraph as well as a preview of my resume and an option to download it. The projects page will provide many more projects of all varieties throughout my learning career. The contact page will have information as to how ot best contact me as well as an email form.
